# Insurance Claims Processing Assistant

## Project Overview
This project is a simple rule-based Insurance Claims Processing Assistant built using Python.  
The goal of the project is to simulate how basic insurance claims can be evaluated using predefined business rules instead of manual checks.

## Problem Statement
In real-world insurance systems, users often face delays because claims need to be manually reviewed for policy validity, claim limits, and document availability. This project demonstrates how an automated assistant can quickly classify claims and provide clear decisions.

## How the System Works
- Claim data is stored in a JSON file
- Each claim is evaluated using a set of predefined rules
- The system categorizes claims as **Approved**, **Rejected**, or **Needs Review**
- A short explanation is provided for every decision

## Technologies Used
- Python
- JSON for sample claim data
- Rule-based decision logic

## Output Example
The assistant processes multiple claims and prints the evaluation result for each claim directly in the terminal.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding more detailed claim rules
- User input for real-time claim evaluation
- Integration with a simple web or chat interface
